                Standing: Aside from the King's personal retinue and army, he has monarchical levies from his vassals. At full fighting strength, the Rasmean army is second only to the army of Valia. <br>

                northern Voration that the canal boats serve

                It symbolizes the blood spilled in splitting the forest from the darkness after the Cataclysm. <br>
                Government: A willing dictatorship. There is no real national government or standing army. Various loose enclaves have their own militias that are willing to gather for times of need. Representatives can petition the "dictator" for 
                assistance but it is rare. Enclaves are traditionally to maintain self-reliance. Much of the economy is based on trade goods, service, hunting and gathering, or community agriculture. <br>
                Standing: Erdruadal is respected in general, but their political power is considered nil due to their policy of war-avoidance.

                Standing: A rising economic powerhouse with a large, regimented standing army. 10 years of service grants permanent minor title and land grant. 20 years of service grants permanent minor title and a major land grant.
                This is leading to a burgeoning fragmentary feudal system with thousands of tiny lords in their tiny fiefdoms. A small army of tax investigators collects tax on all taxes gathered by the minor lords.
                Some settlers hate when the lord comes to town and imposes his taxes, because it brings a sudden end to their settler lifestyle. <br>
