        <div>
            <h3>The deep past</h3>
            <p>
                Something about the gods deciding not to meddle directly in human affairs
            </p>

            <h3>The Cataclysm</h3>
            <p>
                Something something it's not WoW
                Gods stopped being generals and kings so their kingdoms and armies essentially instantly dissolved into infighting and tumult. The entire region of Magora was once the domain of Iuz. Iuz is the half-fiend or cambion demigod son of Graz'zt, a demon lord of the Abyss, and the human witch Iggwilv. Originally described as very handsome, Iuz now appears either as an old man with poisonous spit, or a big, red, hulking demon like creature. His weapon of choice is the whip and greatsword.  He is referred to as "The Old One" or Iuz the Evil, and worshiped as the God of Deceit, Pain, Oppression and Evil.  He is considered the enemy of every sane and free person in the Flanaess and every religion, except his own and holds a particular hatred for Zagyg, Vecna and St. Cuthbert.  
                Iuz was given his kingdom by his father when he proved himself in battle. He lead it with an iron fist, cruelly enslaving every mortal creature he could fit a chain onto. He used Orcs and Ogres as slavedrivers, and goblins lived free lives under their auspices. When the Holy Accord was reached, the vast army of Iuz descended into total chaos, fighting over the vast swathes of slaves left to them. Dozens of slave revolts and mass uprisings edged the orcs out of the jungles of Sharavon and The Horn became a haven. Eventually, an elfen druid named <a href="characters.html#Lyra-Kelthyra">Lyra Kelthyra</a> raised and trained a small army, using it and her natural gifts to drive the orcs first from Du'ned and the forests of Lake Webb, and eventually out of what would become Alliance lands.

            <h3>Portabello</h3>
            <h4>My notes</h4>
            <p>
                I kinda want portabella to be limited in spell levels until he garners more worshippers to the cause. Maybe spell level 3 is locked behind a priest and a temple.

                Reagar calls Portabella over and tells him "I found your mushrooms." He wants 1000 gold pieces for the information, but provides Portabella with a parcel of waxed paper containing 3 mushrooms that have a slight glow.
            </p>
            <p>
                One mushroom per vision <br>
                First vision: Form of the destructor. <br>
                Wisdom check: 1-12: Forms and color jumble together in your mind, images too fleeting to process before you are overcome by more flashes and shapes. The whole experience is relentless and exhausting. Gain 2 levels of exhaustion. <br>
                Wisdom check: 13-19: You enter the familiar realm of altered consciousness and feel immediately that your connection with your god is firmer than it was the first time. You feel he is trying to speak with you directly, presenting images and words faster than you can process them.
                You see an impossibly great snake crushing a forest structure, gnashing the occupants in its great jaws as it swallows groups whole. You see a mushroom-headed dwarf and feel his anguish. You see your own hands setting a column from the structure right again as the mushroom-headed dwarf smiles. You see people approaching, hands stretched out to the dwarf. <br>
                Wisdom check: 20+: You enter the familiar realm of altered consciousness and feel immediately that your connection with your god is firmer than it was the first time. He is speaking to you directly now, feeding images into your thoughts.
                An evil snake-god, eons ago, scoured the earth searching for all the adherants of the minor god Agaricus. Agaricus was powerless to stop it, and tried secreting away his priesthood to no avail. As a last effort, he put his last energies into creating mushrooms that contained his essence and seeding them wherever he could while his life remained.
                The great snake, with its cunning, sniffed out this plan and tried to weed out the mushrooms as well, but failed before the gods were banished from their rovings on the material plane.
                "My powers are limited still, greatest and smallest of my followers." Agaric says gruffly, and you experience a vision of your own hands righting a column that had been laid down by the snake. "I cannot provide you with greater spells without more followers." You see finally Agaric's face, his head a great purple mushroom cap, his beard a wild bush of mycelial roots reaching the ground. He smiles, in his way, gesturing behind you at a throng of new worshippers. The vision abruptly fades. <br>

            <h3>Devren</h3>
            <p>
                Deep in the forest, far removed from civilization lay a hamlet composed of humans and elves. This agrarian community survived off the land and lived simple but complete lives under the stars, amongst nature.
                But it was not long before their successful and undefended trove became the knowledge of a local mercenary family. A family of the Red Scale which would introduce themselves as friendly, bodyguards who would ensure
                no wrong would come to the inhabitants of the town...for a price. A price that became increasingly more expensive as the years ran forward. For a time, the hamlet remained prosperous and bolstered by the knowledge they
                had mighty "allies" who could be summoned in a time of need. A for a time, this was true, the Red Scale stopped Feral Orcs and gnolls from enchroaching, and even returned a kidnapped family to the town when a rival guild attempted to lay claim.
            <p>   
                Then the tithes requirement increased and continued to increase year over year until they could simply not be met....and then the true price of this "alliance" was made clear. Lives. Either in tithe or in punishment. The hamlet considered resisting, but among them they had no fighters. They considered sending for help, but the distance would require much travel and the possibility of being intercepted was great...it was made clear such actions would result in further escalation of the tithe. So they obeyed. Giving the Red Scale one young woman per year.
            </p>
            <p>  
                He would never meet her, but the monks would tell him her name was "Emilia." She had been tithed to the family of scale and rapidly impregnated by one of the elders of the clan. She refused to give her child to these people, this organization of deceit and despair. She fled under cover of darkness and traveled as far as she could before encountering a long vestige of civilization in a remote monastery populated by a dozen Monks who had taken to the seclusion and peace this place offered. She left her newborn in their care and continued to flee. She took the basket she had been carrying him in and filled it with clothes to maintain the ruse of his continued presence. She begged the monks to give him a life that would not carry him into the darkest callings of his blood and they agreed solemnly to impart their wisdom unto him.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Perhaps she was successful and escaped unscathed. Perhaps she was found. Devren would never be truly certain what outcome befell her.
            </p> 
            <p>  
                History would unfold peacefully as Devren grew up amongst his new family. As fortune would have it, one of the monks was quite skilled in Draconic and ensured he could speak his native language, albey with a bizarre accent. His skill and strength would developed and be slowly harnessed by his teachings. He would learn that peace is the first and best path and that all life has value, even in its ending. He would learn the history of his Draconic heritage, the stories that were told of ancient beasts of fire and scale flying through the air, alerting every soul for miles with a roar that shook the very earth. He was always taken with the parts about flying and insisted if he just put his mind to it he would be able to take flight. As a child he would often be found jumping from tall structures, certain this time he would stay aloft...despite not having wings. His peers would find this amusing and gave him the nickname of "Stone" in that he sank like one. He would take this as his Surname in the years that would come. 
            </p>
            <p>     
                For 20 years life was, by all measures, blessed. He had become adept at the culture he was born into and had found respect and comradery among the Monks he believed he would spend the rest of his life with. His mentor, Anquis, approached him one day, telling him he had heard rumor of his mothers location and gave him what little money the monastery possessed in the hopes he might undertake the journey that had always lingered in his heart. To find his origin, to know the truth. Devren accepted this mission and assured his mentor he would return and that he would take his teachings with him every step of every day.
            </p>
            <p>   
                This was a deception. The Red Scale had found him and the monastery and had approaced them in secret demanding they turn him over to them or suffer their wrath. The Monk agreed and then set in motion Devrens escape without his knowledge of the seriousness of the situation. He knew Devren would stay and fight for his family...against his family...and this would only end in great suffering. He also knew that the Red Scale would not accept Devren had simply wandered off and that a terrible toll would be exacted.
            </p>
            <p>  
                Devren stands nearly 7 feet tall and has mostly bronze/rust colored scales across his body, save around his eyes which retain a powerful crimson shade and gives him a somewhat nefarious facial visage when he blinks. He is usually found with a smile on his face which inadvertently reveals several sharp and well maintained teeth. His truthfully happy expression can appear quite aggressive. He wields a quarterstaff that he has carved in the same motif as the scales on his body, with more earthy toned colors and his primary article of clothing is a two piece cloak that hangs where wings might once have been attached to his distant ancestors. He favors royal colors, of gold and silver if possible to offset the implied nature of his reddish tones.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Gabriel Atherion Sentril Algeroth</h3>
            <p>
                Gabriel Atherion Sentril Algeroth of house Algeroth is the son of the noble lord Samot Yntrix Gorot Algeroth and Lady Ettenan Ryna Algeroth. Gabriel had a very privileged upbringing, living in the family's manor together with servants and tutors, showing great interest in literature, art and science. Although he is handy with a blade, and a quick learner of both battle and warfare, he has never been interested in war or adventure. Instead, he was always complacent with the life that was planned for him; getting a good education and taking over the family import and export business the same way his father had done before him and his father before that. The family name holds great weight in higher circles of society and is well respected for being able to deliver goods in a timely manner. The family follows a code of honor and although none of the family patriarchs have ever shied away from a good deal, they tend to stay within the confines of law and order. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, due to the many years of successful and respectable trade, there have been a few instances where shadier elements have tried to use the business for their own needs. Gabriel can recall several instances when strange people have even shown up at the manor and had private meetings with his father, most often resulting in these same people storming out with grim expressions after being denied help. These instances were not a common occurrence but they became a part of daily life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of the visits of strange people, Gabriel, now in his late teens, didn't even shrug when one day there was a knock on the door and outside stood a woman in a long black dress, a large black hat with a raven feather in it and a veiled face, who asked to speak to Gabriels father. The woman introduced herself as Lady Morina de Mon and was accompanied by a very strange entourage of three people. The first was a tall and lanky man dressed in black pants and a tight shirt. His skin was pale, almost white and his eyes were bright blue, almost as if they were glowing. The second two were two girls, both with frazzled black hair, wearing attire similar to Lady Morina but less fancy. The girls were continuously grinning and whispering and similarly to the tall lanky man they had bright blue eyes. Gabriel got a strange feeling from them but shrugged it off, knowing that they would soon leave the same as all other strange people before them. A few hours later, Gabriel could see the group heading off with their carriage as expected. However, during supper there was something different about his father Samot. He seemed disheartened somehow but when Gabriel inquired if had to do with the strange visitors, Samot said that he had dealt with them and that they would not be seeing them again. At first Gabriel was not convinced but when Samot gave Gabriel his normal friendly fatherly smile and changed the topic to something more joyful all of Gabriels worries were washed away.
            </p>
            <p>
                That night there a freakish thunderstorm blew up, tearing at the manor to the extent that the windows were rattling. Gabriel was a heavy sleeper but something stirred his slumber and he awoke in the middle of the night. At first he thought he was just seeing shadows, but then he saw two intense blue orbs in the darkness. He stared at them with a sense of recognition, but just as he realised what they were, and before he could scream, Lady Morina was upon him, holding him down, covering his mouth and speaking an incantation of some sort.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is where the story of Gabriel Atherion Sentril Algeroth ends, and the story of Blank the ragged begins. Confused and scared, Blank ran through the city. He didn't recognise where he was, when it was or even who he was! Stumbling past a shop, he caught his face in a reflection. Studying it he saw a man in his early twenties, dressed in rags and with the beginning of a scruffy beard. He didn't remember, but somehow he felt that the face looking back at him was different, older, then it should be. Looking down on his person, he could see he was wearing old and tattered clothes and had a bag at his side made from leather. Looking quickly in the bag, the first thing he found was a burnt and stained piece of paper, weathered by age to the point that it was barely readable. Readable, Blank realised he could read! Quickly skimming through the paper the only thing he could discern from the ruined document was the three first letters of a name at the bottom, "San". Digging deeper in the bag he also found a bag of 25 gold coins. Realising this, Blank quickly put it back in the leather bag. The last item in the bag was an old and blackened ring made from silver. The ring wasn't remarkable at all but had a distinct and well carved "A" on it. Studying the ring, Blank was suddenly struck by a horrible headache and in his minds eye two blue orbs flashed for a moment before he was once more standing on the street and staring at his reflection. During the memory flash, Blank had stumbled into the glass, and the shop owner had rushed out and started yelling at Blank who set off running through the city. He rounded a corner, and since he was looking behind him, ran straight into (someone from the party).

                - None really. Good guy.

            <h4> My Notes </h4>
            <p>
                His curse is divine in nature, derived from the direct influence of an evil cleric of a chaotic god. They wanted to control trade in Metenai, so they slew his family and put a spirit in his body to head 
                the trade empire. Blank broke free from the spirit after 8 years and fled from its control. The spirit is in an amulet that hung around his neck. His mental blocks and trauma are complications from being under
                its influence for so long.

                    Jedda - Mother
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grulla - her partner the medicine-orc

                    Gordeon Murry - Mentor

                <p>
                    Brogan Murry - His son
                </p>
                <p>
                    My mother, Jedda was the arch druidess in a clan of orcs that wandered the northern tracts of Valia prior to it being liberated by the Alliance. She had some esteem in the clan, previously being the parter of the medicine-orc Grulla
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the liberation of land from the orcs, a commanding officer by the name of Gordeon Murry, appalled by the conduct of the soldiers (raping, malicious acts of violence etc) stumbles through the din of battle into a large tent in a nomadic orc encampment. He walks in on a soldier raping an orc woman. The soldier whips around at the intrusion, and there is an awkward pause and a moment of recognition as father catches his son in the midst of a heinous crime. In that brief instant, the orc woman reaches up and stabs her assailant through the throat. Stunned, after a moments pause, the commanding officer hides the badly beaten orc. He abandons... absconds... elopes? from the army. Why can't I think of the right word, sigh. Anyway he sneaks off, saves the now unconscious orc and flees into the northern foothills, far enough away to set up in anonymity as a farmer. Neither Ro'ash nor his mother know that Gordeon and the soldier were father and son.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My mother set up nearby, in a pimped out shaman cave and makes a meager living dabbling in herbal trade and druidic services to some of the hills orc trolls and whatever else hid up here, out of the way of the conflict
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was trained in combat by Gordeon, who saved my mother. In fact, they raised me in equal measure. I tried to spend as much of my time as possible, training under Gordeon’s eye at his homestead along with some of the other young half-orcs he employed to help run the farm. Being physically gifted, compared to the other half-orcs and a natural talent in combat, Gordeon saw it as his duty to hone my skills. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first time I bested my mentor in combat, he gifted me my sword. The first time I showed mercy, he gifted me my shield. Then I turned 15, he game me armor and told me to make a difference in the world
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    I left my mother and Gordeon behind at the age of 15... I told my mother that if Grulla was still alive, surely we would cross paths 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm 19 now. I’ve been knockin about valia for some time. Sorta drifting. I don't like humans and orcs don't seem to like me. I've roamed the wilds to the south and tried to penetrate a little. At the same time, both testing myself against the strength of the orcs and curious about my orcish ancestry. Somewhere inside lurks a curiosity. No one knows what happened to Jedda’s partner Grulla. The clan was attacked and most were killed. Some escaped. Hearing my mother talk about him as her beloved has built a picture of him in my head as the father I should have had. I don’t admit it to myself, but my desire to find myself ‘accidentally lost’ in the wastes to the south is constant nag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s my first time at the Silver Star. I am not keen on crowds and I don’t especially like humans. I don’t really know what I’m doing here… Short of going headlong into the south alone, this is the last place I have yet to travel. I have half a mind to find people to come south with me, but I don’t have money to pay them. I could work, but I know no one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel somewhat dejected and frustrated. Perhaps the right work would give me the chance to travel some more. It’s at least a way to shake the feeling that I’m doing nothing.
