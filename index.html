                <h3>Raymronuss, Champion of the Green</h3>
                <p>Raymonruss has chosen a small wood in the Torano Foothills as its permanent lair. Her cave is hidden in the banks of a shoreline in the thick forest near the town of Fairweather. There is no good road to fairweather. Near Fairweather
                    is a small training camp for Valian soldiers with an attached farm. The ledger in the captain's quarters says there are 32 men in his employ. The livestock has been slain, and there are 30 corpses. The corpse of the captain and a local hero
                    are missing. (Players can dig into the captain's notes to discover this. They will also find a log of a recent slaying.) <br>
                    going to fairweather may reveal a rumor of a dragon in the foothills to the northwest. People are straight dubious. <br>
                    Fairweather: The Dubious Coin is the name of the tavern, and there aren't rooms as much as small cabins for hire. If they stay the night a drunk will approach portabella and let him know he's seen the dragon. He vastly exagerates its size.
                    The dragon terrorized him, killed his son and wife, and sent him ranting and raving to the town. He's seen as a cook. <br>
                </p>
                <p>In the silver star, there is a troupe of bards, a serious trader with caravan guards, a new ranger and a vagrant half-orc.</p>

            <p>
                Follow that sweet ass guide about the necromancer dude.
                Priestesses of Llira, Our Lady of Eternal Joy, bought a map off of Reagar to a forgotten temple half-buried in earth. He very much exaggerated its state of decay, and also about it being unoccupied. A foul stench was
                detected on approach, and a strange green light was seen inside.

            </h3>
            <p>
                The storm has raged for two full days now. It's one of those late summer squalls that rolls off the mountains like an avalanche, catching traders and rangers alike off their guard. It whispers of the coming autumn.
                The Silver Star is the only public waystation within half a day's ride on the Valian side, and if you have a cart, you'd need the wind at your back to make the journey from sunup to sundown.

                The common room of the Silver Star has had its windows shuttered for two days now. The air smells of smoke and bodies.
