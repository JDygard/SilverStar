                The storm has raged for two full days now. It's one of those late summer squalls that rolls off the mountains like an avalanche, catching traders and rangers alike off their guard. It whispers of the coming autumn.
                The Silver Star is the only public waystation within half a day's ride on the Valian side, and if you have a cart, you'd need the wind at your back to make the journey from sunup to sundown.

                The common room of the Silver Star has had its windows shuttered for two days now. The air smells of smoke and bodies.
