            <h3>
                Red Hand
            </h3>
            <p>
                Leader: Corloc, a shaman in commune with extraplanar demons. He leads his clan with cunning and his raw skill with magics.<br>
                <indent>
                    Their clan makes the lives in the swamps south of the badlands. They were the first to flee when the Valian army swept through the highlands. Where before, they lived in relative harmony
                    with the other clans, they vied hard to put Corloc on the high throne during the Tumult. They were nearly single-handedly responsible for the slaughter of swaths of the Torkill clan, including thier
                    wise druid chief Dreamwalker, forcing them to disband and join the Ul-goloth clan. Their military consists of loose militias headed by powerful disciples of Corloc.

                Ul-goloth
            </h3>
            <p>
                Leader: Goloth, a collossal orc even among other orcs. He rules by pure strength and his axe, Windstalker.<br>
                <indent>
                    Ul-goloth clan territory makes up the largest part of the "border" lands with Valian. They have in their ranks goblins, kobolds and bugbears, and have no problem with slavery.  Their wolf-riders are 
                    feared throughout Valian and are known to raid deep within that territory from time to time, burning villages and taking slaves for food and labor. Their role in the Tumult was that of total aggressor,
                    trying bravely to crush the Silver Star and break the Alliance's foothold in Orcish lands. They were the last to flee en masse to the more barren shrublands south of Valian, disappearing into the hills, 
                    valleys and complex cave systems that make up that region.

                Turungal
            </h3>
            <p>
                Leader: Fith, an orc of slight build with unexpected cunning. He has transformed his lands to the west of Ul-Goloth and on the southern border of Ul-goloth into a treacherous haven for his people.
                <indent>
                    Venturing into these lands is a folly which no-one of right mind makes anymore. Pockmarked with deadfall traps, rockfall traps, nets and cunning ambush parties, it is treacherous. They largely keep to
                    themselves and have mostly become a mystery to others. Internally they are building up an armory and intend to dominate the weaker clans to the south.

                Bad-dur
            </h3>
            <p>
                Leader: Faranga, a female orc whose mastery of mounted combat has made her clan a formidible foe.
                <indent>
                    Their clan is entirely nomadic, moving with the herds of animals that make their home in the broad sarengetti south of Turungal. They are masters of mounted combat, using longbows from wolfback to devastating
                    effect. Their numbers are much lower than that of their neighbors, but they make up for it in their ability to choose when they engage in combat.

                High Watch Clan
            </h3>
            <p>
                Leader: Ga'kalach, a brutish heriditary chieftain, largely reviled by his people. His close cabal of strong-armed companions is held in check by his subtle political intrigue.
                <indent>
                    High Watch is largely a military state, ruled on high from an ancient ruined fort atop an outlook cliff in the rocky lands on the southern tip of the peninsula. Their military is standing and mighty,
                    but their ability to project power is limited largely by fear that an army on the move can't be used to protect Ga'Kalach's interests at home.

                The Tower of Glamour is the only physical embodiment of this faction. It is located in Glorphein, a largely wild region south of Magora.
                Well-known for their long-standing research into enchantment and runic spells. Their extremely picky recruiting habits limit their numbers, but their services are the best in the world.
