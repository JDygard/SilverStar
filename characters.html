        <h2>The Silver Star</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Brock</h3>
            <p> 
                Brock is a half-orc soldier, through and through. His face shows the scars of untold numbers of battles.
                He is good-natured, quiet and not disposed to self aggrandizement.
                His role in the conclusion of the Hundred Years War with the orcish clans is legend. After the slaying of Oui'Zil, he was left with a small force to help hold the Silver Star against retaliation.
                They held out for 3 months, without consistent supplies or ammunition, fashioning arrows from swamp saplings and crudely nailing shields into the portcullis to defend.
                After the war's successful conclusion, he was left in charge of the now-largely-pointless fort. Over time it became a waystation of sorts, converting barracks into an inn, and a common room into a 
                bustling tavern. He keeps the portcullis greased, and still goes out with a crew to clear the areas around the fort of brush and saplings to keep it defensible, but his role as Captain in the Valian Guard
                has deteriorated into a comfortable life as a barkeep.

            <h3>Reagar Fallenforest</h3>
            <p>
                Reagar is a closed-lipped ranger, who searches the wilds of Valia in search of forgotten catacombs, temples and other ruins. He makes his living selling the treasures found therein, or if they are too dangerous,
                selling the information about their whereabouts. He has a good relationship with Brock, who considers him a casual friend and trusts him.

            <h3>Dagron Wildbrace</h3>
            <p>
                Close friend and 2nd in command of the Silver Star. He has fallen into the role of commander of the forces stationed at the Star, and takes his job with the seriousness of anyone stationed in boredom for years on end.
                He holds training in the courtyard for four hours a day with half the troops, and Brock holds it with the rest. He can sometimes be seen at the bar with Brock, talking in hushed tones with whoever has come with information.

        <h2>Valia</h2>
        <div>
            <h3> King Valgian </h3>
            <p>
                King Valgian is known far and wide for his personal combat prowess, leadership ability, and his role in the end of the Hundred Years' War. It was he who gathered a band of intrepid adventurers to play assassin,
                sneaking deep into Orcish tribal lands to strike at it's heart: the warren of Oui'Zil. He and his band slew Oui'Zil and his whole brood in their pit, then cut a swath of destruction as they fled to the safety of
                civilized lands behind the Silver Star. He returned into the chaos of the leadership dispute in the Orcish lands and split the tribes, cornering them one-by-one and driving them en masse out into the barren lands 
                to the south.
